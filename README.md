A repository of R code regarding ways to analyze data from a case (UVA-QA-0702) 
presented in the First Year Decision Analysis course at Darden. The basis for the 
data is a case regarding a hopeless romantic MBA student choosing the right diamond 
for his bride-to-be, Sarah.

### System Setup
The R programming language will be utilized in this analysis of diamonds. Using 
R requires installing it locally on your computer and some basic knowledge to run 
the code that performs the analysis.

#### Installing R and RStudio
First, install [R](http://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#Desktop). 
There are some instructions available [here](http://stat545.com/block000_r-rstudio-install.html) to 
aid in the installation process. RStudio is called an "IDE", or interactive development environment, 
which means that its a specific software tool for allowing you to write and execute 
R code to develop your analyses. It is highly recommended that you install and use 
RStudio. Once you've installed R and RStudio you may want to review some materials 
to understand how to use it. The article [R basics, workspace and working directory, RStudio projects](http://stat545.com/block002_hello-r-workspace-wd-project.html) provides a 
very good introduction to using R.

#### Installing R Packages
Second, R uses "packages" of functions that people develop to perform very specific 
routines in R, like fitting a decision tree. These packages must be installed before 
referencing them, so in order to run code in this repository you must first open 
up RStudio, and copy-paste the following code into your Console. Don't be alarmed if 
red text pops up and text starts wizzing by on the screen. This means that the 
package installations are happening. Once they're done, your computer is setup 
to do some advanced machine learning!

```
# data manipulation packages
install.packages("MASS")
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("tidyr")
install.packages("lubridate")
# time series packages
install.packages("zoo")
install.packages("forecast")
install.packages("tseries")
# modeling packages
install.packages("rpart")
install.packages("rpart.plot")
install.packages("glmnet")
install.packages("randomForest")
install.packages("gbm")
```

### The Data
The data contains 9,142 records on individual diamonds and their attributes. The 
attributes cover many common characteristics to consider when valuing and choosing 
diamonds, such as the 4 C's (Carat, Cut, Color, Clarity) along with price. The 
data are split into 6,000 records labeled as "Train" meant to be used when 
building models and the remaining 3,142 records are labeled as "Test" and meant 
to be used in assessing model accuracy

Variable | Datatype | Definition
---|---|---------
ID | integer | Uniquely identifies each observation (diamond)
Carat Weight | numeric | The weight of the diamond in metric carats. One carat is equal to 0.2 grams, roughly the same weight as a paperclip
Cut | One of five values indicating the cut of the diamond in the following order of desireability (`Signature-Ideal`, `Ideal`, `Very Good`, `Good`, `Fair`)
Color | One of six values indicating the diamond's color in the following order of desireability (`D`, `E`, `F` - Colorless, `G`, `H`, `I` - Near colorless)
Clarity | One of seven values indicating the diamond's clarity in the following order of desireability (`F` - Flawless, `IF` - Internally Flawless, `VVS1` or `VVS2` - Very, Very Slightly Included, or `VS1` or `VS2` - Very Slightly Included, `SI1` - Slightly Included)
Polish | One of four values indicating the diamond's polish (`ID` - Ideal, `EX` - Excellent, `VG` - Very Good, `G` - Good)
Symmetry | One of four values indicating the diamond's symmetry (`ID` - Ideal, `EX` - Excellent, `VG` - Very Good, `G` - Good)
Report | One of of two values `"AGSL"` or `"GIA"` indicating which grading agency reported the qualities of the diamond qualities
Price | numeric | The amount in USD that the diamond is valued
Dataset | character | One of two values `"Train"` or `"Test"` indicating whether the observation should be used to train the model or in a test of its accuracy
